- 💬 As a wise man once said, *"Heaven does not create one person above or below another."* People like to throw these words around. That's not the whole quote. It goes on to say that *"... while we are all equal at birth, pretty soon, things begin to change. The academics and efforts are what set some people apart to rise above others."*.
